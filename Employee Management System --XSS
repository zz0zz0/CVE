XSS in SourceCodester Employee Management System 1.0 (add-admin.php)

Affected Locations: 
/employee_akpoly/Admin/add-admin.php, txtfullname parameter

Description:
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:
Data enters a web application through an untrusted source. In the case of persistent (also known as stored) XSS, the untrusted source is typically a database or other back-end data store. 

Proof of Concept:
As observed in the screenshot below, when we send a XSS payload query(we use "</div>" to close <div> tag in HTML) in the "txtfullname" field for the "Add User" portal, the page of "Admin Record" shows an alert, suggesting a persistent XSS vulnerability.
